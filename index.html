      <h3>GALAXY</h3>
      <p>
        A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants,
        interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from
        the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the
        Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred
        million (10<sup>8</sup>) stars to giants with one hundred trillion
        (10<sup>14</sup>) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as
        elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have
        supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black
        hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater
        than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant
        observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from
        Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big
        Bang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research released in 2016 revised the number of galaxies in the
        observable universe from a previous estimate of 200 billion
        (2×10<sup>11</sup>) to a suggested two trillion (2×10<sup>12</sup>) or
        more and, overall, as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars (more stars than
        all the grains of sand on planet Earth). Most of the galaxies are 1,000
        to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light
        years) and separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs
        (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at
        least 30,000 parsecs (100,000 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda
        Galaxy, its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)

      <h3>SUN</h3>
      <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
        perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that
        generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most
        important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39
        million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its
        mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86%
        of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the
        Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium
        (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including
        oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral
        class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred
        to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It
        formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
        collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of
        this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an
        orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so
        hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core.
        It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

      <h3>MOON</h3>
      <p>
        The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth and is the planet's only
        natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar
        System, and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to
        the size of the planet that it orbits. The Moon is, after Jupiter's
        satellite Io, the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among
        those whose densities are known.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not
        long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon
        formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and
        a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia. New research of Moon rocks,
        although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may
        be older than previously thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows
        the same side to Earth, the near side. Because of libration, slightly
        more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from
        Earth. The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the
        spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent
        impact craters. After the Sun, the Moon is the second-brightest
        celestial object regularly visible in Earth's sky. Its surface is
        actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very
        bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn
        asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body
        tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.
